\section{Structure}
\label{appendix:structure}

In the main matter, the structure is in the following order:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 Chapters
    \item 1.1 Sections
    \item 1.1.1 Subsections
    \item Subsubsections
    \item Paragraphs
    \item Subparagraphs
\end{itemize}

Though, in appendix we gather all appendices under the chapter ''Appendices'', and thus, each appendix is a section. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not use the chapter command in appendix.

Appendix structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Section
    \item A.1 Subsections
\end{itemize}
